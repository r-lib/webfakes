Lightweight fake web apps for testing. Built using the
[civetweb](https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb) embedded web server.

## Features

-   Complete web app framework, define handlers for HTTP requests in R.
-   Write your own app for your custom test cases; our use app similar
    to the `https://httpbin.org` API, so often you donâ€™t need to write
    your own web app (e.g.Â if you are writing an HTTP client (httr,
    curl, crul).
-   Run one web app per test suite, per test file or per test case.
-   Flexible path matching, with parameters and regular expressions.
-   Built in templating system using glue or bring your own template
    engine.
-   Middleware to parse JSON, multipart and URL encoded request bodies.
-   A web app is just an R object. It can be saved to disk, copied to
    another R process, etc.
-   A web app is extensible, by adding new routes and middleware to it.
-   Helper functions for sending JSON, files from disk, etc.
-   App-specific environment to store any data including data from
    requests to the fake app.
-   After a web app is launched from R, you can interact with it from R
    but also from the command line, your browser, etc. Nice for
    debugging.
-   The web server runs in the R process, so it has no problems with
    local firewalls.
-   Multi-threaded web server supports concurrent HTTP requests.
-   Limit download speed to simulate low bandwidth.

## Optional dependencies

-   The jsonlite package is needed for the `mw_json()` middleware, the
    `response$send_json()` method and the `httpbin_app()` app.
-   The glue package is needed for the `tmpl_glue()` template engine.
-   The callr package is needed for `new_app_process()` and
    `local_app_process` to work.
-   The `/brotli` endpoint of `httpbin_app()` needs the brotli package.
-   The `/deflate` endpoint of `httpbin_app()` needs the zip package.
-   The `/digest-auth` endpoint of `httpbin_app()` needs the digest
    package.
-   `git_app()` requires the processx package.

## Installation

Install the release version from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("webfakes")
```

If you need the development version of the package, install it from
GitHub:

``` r
pak::pak("r-lib/webfakes")
```

## Usage

Start a web app at the beginning of your tests or test file, and stop it
after. Here is an example with the testthat package. Suppose you want to
test that your `get_hello()` function can query an API:

`local_app_process()` helps you clean up the web server process after
the test block, or test file. It is similar to the `withr::local_*`
functions.

``` r
app <- webfakes::new_app()
app$get("/hello/:user", function(req, res) {
  res$send(paste0("Hello ", req$params$user, "!"))
})
web <- webfakes::local_app_process(app)

test_that("can use hello API", {
  url <- web$url("/hello/Gabor")
  expect_equal(get_hello(url), "Hello Gabor!")
})
```

When testing HTTP clients you can often use the built in
`httpbin_app()`:

``` r
httpbin <- webfakes::local_app_process(webfakes::httpbin_app())
```

``` r
test_that("HTTP errors are caught", {
  url <- httpbin$url("/status/404")
  resp <- httr::GET(url)
  expect_error(httr::stop_for_status(resp), class = "http_404")
})
```
