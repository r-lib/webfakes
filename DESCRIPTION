Description: Create a web app that makes it easier to test web clients
  without using the internet. It includes a web app framework with path
  matching, parameters and templates. Can parse various 'HTTP' request
  bodies. Can send 'JSON' data or files from the disk. Includes a web app
  that implements the <https://httpbin.org> web service.
