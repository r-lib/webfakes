<li>Civetweb is small and simple. C code only. Embedding it is
trivial.</li>
<li>The main developer is nice and very responsive. The project is
active.</li>
<li>The code is portable and works OOB on all OSes I tried.</li>
<li>It has some nice features built in, e.g. limiting the download
speed.</li>

<ul>
<li>httpuv is an alternative. It is heavier, contains all of libuv, and
it also needs 7 non-core packages. AFAICT it does not have an easy way
to delay a response.</li>
<li>We could also use libuv directly. This would be more difficult, we
would probably need to deal more with the internals. I.e. IOCPs, polls,
etc. Libuv also does not have HTTP, so we would need to implement that
or use another library.</li>
<li>We could also use R’s internal web server. This means redefining the
default handlers for the help, but that is fine, because we would only
do this temporarily. But the internal web server is very limited, it
only handles GET and POST requests, and does not give you enough
information about the requests. It also does not support delaying a
response.</li>
<li>Mongoose is am embedded web server, that civetweb was forked from
originally. Its license is GPL-2, so it is more restrictive.</li>

<p>Threads:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The main R thread.</li>
<li>The main web server thread.</li>
<li>Request threads, they are created for new connections.</li>
<li>Web server worker threads.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main rule here is that only the main R thread can call a function
from the R API. The civetweb callbacks run on the civetweb threads, so
they cannot call any R API. Currently we only use the
<code>begin_request()</code> callback, and this is called from the
request threads. So we need to synchronize between the request threads
and the main R thread.</p>
<p>We essentially have a producer-consumer problem, with a single
consumer, the main R thread, and multiple producers, the request
threads. Having a single consumer means that the queue to store the jobs
is of length one. This is a good guide on how to solve such a problem:
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E36784_01/html/E36868/sync-31.html" class="external-link uri">https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E36784_01/html/E36868/sync-31.html</a></p>
<p>We need two conditions, to signal that 1) there is something to work
on, and that 2) new work may come in. We also need a mutex to be able to
wait on these conditions. These are stored in the <code>user_data</code>
of the civetweb server instance:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">struct</span> server_user_data <span class="op">{</span></span>

<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" tabindex="-1"></a>  pthread_cond_t process_less<span class="op">;</span>  <span class="co">/* we can process something */</span></span>

<span id="cb1-8"><a href="#cb1-8" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">};</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>nextconn</code> is the queue, it is used to pass the request
from a request thread to the main R thread. When a request thread comes
in, it has to make sure that <code>nextconn</code> is <code>NULL</code>,
so waits on <code>process_less</code>. Once given the green light, it
sets <code>nextconn</code> to the civetweb connection object, and then
wait on its own <code>finish_cond</code> condition, which is stored in
the connection specific user data:</p>

<p>The main R thread can use the <code>user_data</code> of
<code>next_conn</code> to access all information about the connection
and the request. Once the main R thread is done with processing the
request, it sets the connection’s <code>req_todo</code> field to
non-zero, and signals the connection’s <code>finish_cond</code>
condition to allow the request thread to continue. Then it also signals
the <code>process_less</code> condition of the server, to let other
request threads in.</p>
<p>Currently the main R thread can set <code>req_todo</code> to two
different values.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>WEBFAKES_DONE</code> means that the request was processed, and
the request thread can quit. Most requests are like this.</li>
<li>
<code>WEBFAKES_WAIT</code> means that the request thread still needs
to stay around and sleep for the specified number of <code>secs</code>.
After sleeping for the specified amount of time, the request thread will
signal <code>process_more</code> again, notifying the main R thread, but
it also sets <code>main_todo</code> to <code>WEBFAKES_WAIT</code>, so
the main R thread knows that this is not a new request. The main R
thread can just take the stored request from the <code>req</code> field
of the connection user data in this case.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a response that is sent out in multiple pieces, this is not
possible if the status code and the headers have been sent out already.
In this case we just send out the R error message.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="errors-in-the-c-code-while-processing-the-request-or-response-">Errors in the C code while processing the request or response.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#errors-in-the-c-code-while-processing-the-request-or-response-"></a>
</h3>
<p>Errors that happen in the C code while processing the request or the
response are different, because most probably we cannot send anything
meaningful to the client. E.g. the most frequent such error happens when
the connection breaks or the client closes the connection. These errors
are caught in the <code>server_poll()</code> and
<code>response_*()</code> R functions, and printed to the screen (see
<code>server.R</code>). If they originate from civetweb, then they are
also logged in the civetweb error log. These errors invalidate the
request, and finish the processing callback. This is implemented by the
<code>server.R</code> functions (re)throwing a
<code>webfakes_error</code>, which is caught and then silently ignored
by the processing loop.</p>
<p>See ‘Resource cleanup’ below for how resources are cleaned up on
error.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="delayed-responses">Delayed responses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#delayed-responses"></a>
</h2>
<p>See the ‘Multithreading’ section above as well.</p>
<p>We create a <code>req</code> object for an incoming request, before
passing it to R from C. This object is an environment and it is kept
until the response to the request is completely sent out. (Or the
connection is closed for some reason.) The <code>req</code> object is
also added to the connection user data of civetweb. Additionally, the
server keeps an list (environment) of all request objects. The latter
makes sure that the request object is not garbage collected, so we don’t
need to worry about that.</p>
<p>When a response is delayed, the app makes a note about the position
of the handler function in the handler stack (in
<code>.stackptr</code>), so that this handler function can be called
again, after the delay.</p>
<p>Then it calls <code>response_write()</code> which sends a
<code>WEBFAKES_WAIT</code> message to the request thread. Then the main
R thread can continue processing and potentially serving other requests,
assuming the server has been started with at least two threads. After
the wait, the request thread sends a message to the main R thread again,
and the app’s poll call will get the same request object for the second
(etc.) time. The app starts calling the handler functions from the
recorded <code>.stackptr</code> position.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="interruption">Interruption<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#interruption"></a>
</h2>
<p>The server runs until it is interrupted. (From the console or
remotely via <code>processx::process$interrupt()</code>.)</p>
<p>We need to make sure that the server can be interrupted while waiting
for new requests (i.e. the main R thread waiting on the
<code>process_more</code> condition, see ‘Multithreading’ above).
<code>pthread_cond_wait()</code> is interrupted by <code>SIGINT</code>
on Unix, seemingly, but not on Windows, so we need to use
<code>pthread_cond_timedwait()</code>. We currently check for interrupts
every 50ms. If the server is interrupted at this point, no cleanup is
needed needed, as it does not hold any resources. In fact the functions
in <code>server.R</code> will keep the server intact, with all delayed
responses, and it is possible to call <code>server_poll()</code> again.
But the <code>app$listen()</code> method does clean up the server in
this case. Maybe this will change in the future.</p>
<p>In theory the C code cannot be interrupted at any other points. On
the other hand the R API functions might error any time, so we do need
proper cleanup everywhere, see the ‘Resource cleanup’ section below.</p>
<p>If the R code is interrupted, the <code>server.R</code> functions do
not need any cleanup. (In theory some error messages might get lost if
the timing is extremely unfortunate and a <code>server.R</code> function
is handling an error when the interrupt happens.)</p>
<p>The <code>app$listen()</code> method cleans up the server in
<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/on.exit.html" class="external-link">on.exit()</a></code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="resource-cleanup">Resource cleanup<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#resource-cleanup"></a>
</h2>
<p>See also ‘Interruption’ just above.</p>
<p>There are some points in the C code where R errors happen while the
code is holding resources. We use (a copy of) the cleancall package to
take care of resource cleanup here.</p>
<p>The first such place is the <code>server_poll()</code> C function,
after a request is in from the request thread. Creating an R object for
the request involves a lot of R API calls, and if one of them fails, we
need to clean up the resources associated with this connection. (The
error will be logged and the R <code>server_poll()</code> function will
continue polling.) The cleanup in this case involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending a <code>WEBFAKES_DONE</code> message to the request thread,
so it will quit.</li>
<li>Removing the request from the server’s list of current
requests.</li>
<li>Signaling the <code>process_less</code> condition, to let other
threads know that we are again ready to process requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other functions that need cleanup are the C functions that work on
the response: <code>response_delay()</code>,
<code>response_send_headers()</code>, <code>response_send()</code> and
<code>response_write()</code>. These cleanups are very similar to the
one for <code>server_poll()</code>.</p>
<p>The finalizer of the server object takes care of cleaning up all
resources associated with a server, including all request objects and
request threads. This is also called by the <code>server_stop()</code> R
function, which is in turn called by the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/on.exit.html" class="external-link">on.exit()</a></code> on the
<code>listen()</code> method. The finalizer uses the list of requests in
the tag of the xptr object to walk over all requests, and finish all
request threads.</p>
<p>Thread that are sleeping because of a delayed response frequently
check a server-wide shutdown flag, which the finalizer also sets, so
these threads quit as well. Then the finalizer calls the civetweb
function <code>mg_stop()</code>. <code>mg_stop()</code> has its own
shutdown flag and waits for all request and worker threads to quit.
Given that we just cleaned up all of them, there shouldn’t be too many,
and if there were any just coming in, they’ll also observe out shutdown
flag and quit quickly.</p>
